# Translate64

## The application

**Translate 64** is a Java application that converts files to their Base64 equivalents. The resulting string is copied to the clipboard.

In some particular cases, I had to embed files within PHP scripts, e.g., an image or script. PHP can easily decode a Base64 string, so I decided to write a simple application to generate the proper strings.
